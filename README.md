## UX User Experience

### Project Goals

* To build a simple, fun and intuitive game for users of any age to play. NBA world is designed for fans who enjoy card flipping games, 
basketball and sports in general.

### User Stories

*	To know what genre of game they’re playing or what the game is about
* To easily be able to access the rules on how to play the game
* Have a fun and visually pleasing game
* See visual cues that make it obvious to the user it’s a basketball game
* Have the option of listening to sound/music or turning it off whilst playing the game
* Be able to contact the site owner with any possible queries/enquiries
* Navigate back to the home page in one click
* To have a timer and score in the game that is responsive to the users input 

### Design

* The colour of the footer is an shade of orange and brown to represent a basketball. I have used this colour throughout in the modal, buttons for consistency. 
* The large hero image on both index.html and amateur-game.html grab the user’s attention due to the bold choice of pictures and clarity that this is basketball
related.

### Typography

*	The 'Gentium Book Basic' font is used to display larger text such as the headers, overlays and buttons in NBA world as the font catches your attention 
straight away due to it’s large and easy to read nature, sans-serif is the fall back font in case there is a problem loading my first choice font. 
* Lato is used in the modal to add contrast to NBA world and it’s popularity due to it’s clean and simple nature.

### Further Testing

* The webstite has been tested on Google Chrome, and Safari web browsers

* Numerous amounts of testing was done where I was clicking on different pages to make sure that all web links work on all types of devices
* Friends and family tested the website on either their phones, laptops and tablets and informed me of any issues that arose and how they found using the website

### Known Bugs

* In the game if the user clicks on the same card twice it will display the other identical card and count as a match
* On Iphone and Ipad it was noticed that the music sound button in the amateur game mode styling does not appear and is missing the white background box like 
on all other screen displays
* On Iphone and Ipad the game ends early with around 2 to 3 seconds left in game roughly
* On Iphone devices the overlay text does not display in center of web page as should do
